Timing Issues: The delay after powering on the displays was too short, not giving them enough time to initialize properly.

digitalWrite(powerPin, LOW);
delay(2000); // This delay might be too short for proper initialization
Power Control: The displays need to be powered on during initialization and updating, then powered off to avoid conflicts on the I2C bus.

digitalWrite(DISPLAY1_ENABLE, HIGH);
digitalWrite(DISPLAY2_ENABLE, HIGH);
digitalWrite(DISPLAY3_ENABLE, HIGH);
Initialization and Update: The displays were not being properly initialized and updated while powered on.



if(!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, DEFAULT_OLED_ADDR)) {
  Serial.println(F("SSD1306 allocation failed"));
  for(;;);
}
display.clearDisplay();
display.display();

your code was actually really close to being correct its just displays were being powered off immediately after being powered on, without sufficient time for initialization.
By increasing the delay and ensuring the displays are powered on during initialization and updates, the displays can properly show different messages. 1. Microcontroller Basics
