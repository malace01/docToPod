my name is malik and currently im a student comp sci st andrews, interning currently at x.My main interest in terms of both career and life goal is to always keep learning in a way that produces practical benefit ( and profit): whether that's contributing to open source AI development tools such as Ivy,working on, researching, documenting and benchmarking cloud computational abilities to pave the way for companies such as brev.dev to exist, using and applying psychology concepts to create and revamp and innovating in the videogame/nft/ 'digital service purchaseables' sphere, or simply creating software that makes life easy and more cost efficient, my goal is and always will be to make maximal impact through both knowledge and interpersonal skills.

In South Korea, many eSports players start playing video games at a young age, often beginning in elementary school. However, serious training and participation in competitive gaming typically start in their early to mid-teens. South Korean eSports academies and training centers often recruit  around the age of 12-15, grooming them for professional play.
In the United States and EU, the pattern is somewhat similar, with many players jowadays starting to play video games at a young age. Serious involvement in eSports  usuallg begins quite a bit later   in the teenage years and  structured development through academies is Farless common compared to South Korea. In the U.S., the path to becoming a professional eSports player is more varied , far less structured snd ultimately less direct.

Overall, infrastructure and support systems for developing professional eSports players in South Korea are far  more established and systematic compared to the U.S., leading to a more formalized path from an earlier age,whjch naturally means earlier , longer and more intense development in the field.

Structured Training Systems: South Korea has a more formalized and rigorous training infrastructure for eSports. Young players often enter academies that provide structured training, coaching, and regular competitive practice. This professional approach to training from an early age helps in developing advanced skills and discipline.

Cultural Acceptance: eSports enjoys a high level of cultural acceptance in South Korea, viewed as a viable career path. This societal support encourages early and intense dedication to the sport.

Government and Corporate Support: The South Korean government and major corporations actively support eSports through funding, infrastructure, and national leagues. This support provides resources and opportunities not as readily available in the US and EU.

Competitive Environment: The eSports scene in South Korea is highly competitive, with a large pool of talented players pushing each other to higher levels of performance. This intense competitive pressure fosters skill development and innovation in gameplay.
