Work Web Copilot Hi again. I’m happy to help you with anything. How can I make your day better? You Sent by you: hi. I run an overwatch coaching business. I want to make clear simple and easy to understand constructive criticism, and provide suggestions. it is as follows. say that OWCA might be a coaching business on the micro level, but really what it does on macro level, is allow those who want to improve at overwatch to buy their time back; on average it takes 400 hours to go up a rank in overwatch without coaching, which equals at minimum 4000 dollars in marginal cost. our service users average 100 hours per rank climb, and we charge 25 dollars a month. we essentially give someone 300 hours back aka 3000 dollars. our marketing direction should make it seem like it's irresponsible to not invest the money because the benefit is too great - think Herman miller chairs being over 1000 dollars but people buy them because it would be silly not to invest in their long term spinal health, they value it more than 1000 dollars. secondly, our free classes are giving an entire pastry rather than a sample of a pastry- potential customers may already be full because the free pastry was already satisfying. the free classes should be solid , short and leave you wanting more- which is why we need to make the paid version seem so much better even tho free one is already good , it's just too small to be satiated. give example of similar service with this model.people really like 1:1 coaching because it's in human pysche to seek attention- free members can submit 2 minute segment of a vod with a question, do round robin of 10 free members, then 1 OWCA + full vod review every now and then to show diff. Copilot Sent by Copilot: Hi! It sounds like you have a solid foundation for your Overwatch coaching business. Here are some suggestions to refine your messaging and strategy: Constructive Criticism and Suggestions Macro-Level Value Proposition: Current Message: “OWCA might be a coaching business on the micro level, but really what it does on a macro level is allow those who want to improve at Overwatch to buy their time back.” Suggested Message: “At OWCA, we don’t just coach; we give you back your time. Without coaching, it takes an average of 400 hours to climb a rank in Overwatch, costing you at least $4000 in marginal cost. Our clients achieve the same in just 100 hours, saving 300 hours and $3000. Investing in our coaching is a smart choice, much like investing in a high-quality Herman Miller chair for your long-term health.” Marketing Direction: Current Message: “Our marketing direction should make it seem like it’s irresponsible to not invest the money because the benefit is too great.” Suggested Message: “Choosing OWCA is a wise investment in your gaming future. Just as people invest in premium ergonomic chairs for their health, investing in our coaching saves you time and money, making it an essential decision for serious gamers.” Free Classes: Current Message: “Our free classes are giving an entire pastry rather than a sample of a pastry.” Suggested Message: “Our free classes are designed to give you a taste of what we offer—enough to be satisfying but leaving you wanting more. Think of it as a delicious sample that makes you crave the full experience. Our paid classes take this to the next level, offering comprehensive coaching that truly elevates your game.” 1:1 Coaching Appeal: Current Message: “People really like 1:1 coaching because it’s in human psyche to seek attention.” Suggested Message: “1:1 coaching taps into our natural desire for personalized attention and tailored feedback. For free members, we offer the opportunity to submit a 2-minute VOD segment with a question. We then do a round-robin review of 10 free members, plus a full VOD review from an OWCA coach occasionally to showcase the difference.” Example of a Similar Service Model Duolingo: Free Version: Offers a substantial amount of content for free, enough to get users started and engaged. Paid Version: Provides additional features like ad-free learning, offline access, and progress tracking, making the paid version more appealing for serious learners. By implementing these suggestions, you can create a compelling narrative that highlights the value of your coaching services and encourages potential clients to invest in their gaming improvement. How does this approach sound to you? You Sent by you: now for marketing, I want to say that ow2 ' streaming space has high viewership and matured big names . this gives us two options : either implicitly promote owca+ with a big streamer through humour first to captivate then giving knowledge - think flats doing his vod reviews then introduces mystery coach (wink wink ) who delivers the knowledge in funny and enticing way. second option is to disrupt the scene- OWCA has 700 members , which is decent viewership on twitch for. OW2, enough for ppl to randomly click. there should be 3 -5 streamers for OWCA , and they should have great comedic and dramatic chemistry as teammates in OW.every couple of games a OWCA coach ( audience won't know except OWCA members already) who roasts their GamePlay and coaches with focus on engagement via humour or personality. once traction starts building, plug OWCA+ in .you can do smth similar on yt with a group of 3 or 4 medium rank , colourful personalities like kazeem galazis Dutch type, they play a comp game together with intention of driving engagement via humour jokes whatever , think of frogger or saltyphish. the comp game gets edited to 5 min of best bits or important bits. after it , the OWCA coach character( he should aim to be memeable) roasts them and educated them via flaming them,editing into meme clips etc so it feels more like YT vid than live coaching. do this in episode fashion as they climb ranks , and people will naturally ask about the coach character and that's where U plug OWCA plus in. also short form content needs to be pumped out , and perhaps an App for only OWCA+ members Copilot Sent by Copilot: Your marketing strategy for OWCA+ sounds innovative and engaging! Here’s a refined version of your plan, highlighting the key points and making it clear and easy to understand: Marketing Strategy for OWCA+ 1. Leveraging High Viewership and Big Names in OW2 Streaming Option 1: Implicit Promotion with a Big Streamer Concept: Collaborate with a popular streamer like Flats. Execution: Use humor to captivate the audience during VOD reviews. Introduce a “mystery coach” who delivers knowledge in a funny and enticing way. Example: During a VOD review, Flats could say, “Let’s see what our mystery coach has to say about this play,” followed by a humorous yet insightful analysis. Option 2: Disrupt the Scene with OWCA Streamers Concept: Utilize OWCA’s 700 members to create a unique streaming experience. Execution: Have 3-5 OWCA streamers with great comedic and dramatic chemistry play together. Every few games, introduce an OWCA coach (unknown to the audience but known to OWCA members) who roasts their gameplay and provides coaching with a focus on humor and personality. Build traction and then plug OWCA+. 2. YouTube Strategy with Engaging Personalities Concept: Create engaging content with a group of medium-rank, colorful personalities. Execution: Form a group of 3-4 personalities like Kazeem Galazis. Play competitive games together, driving engagement through humor and jokes. Edit the gameplay into 5-minute videos highlighting the best and most important bits. Introduce the OWCA coach character who roasts and educates them through meme-worthy clips. Release content in an episodic fashion as they climb ranks, naturally leading to curiosity about the coach character and plugging OWCA+. 3. Short-Form Content and Exclusive App Short-Form Content: Execution: Regularly produce and share short-form content on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts. Focus on quick tips, funny moments, and highlights from streams and coaching sessions. Exclusive App for OWCA+ Members: Concept: Develop an app exclusively for OWCA+ members. Features: Access to premium content and coaching sessions. Notifications for new videos and streams. Community features to connect with other members and coaches.
